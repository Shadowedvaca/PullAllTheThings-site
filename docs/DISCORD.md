**📖 PATT Website & Bot — Quick Guide**

**🌐 The Website** — pullallthethings.com

**No login needed:**
- **Home** — Guild info, officers, recruiting status, and raid schedule
- **Roster** (`/roster`) — Full guild roster with class/spec/ilvl, composition breakdown, and a Wowhead comp link
- **Crafting Corner** (`/crafting-corner`) — Browse what guild members can craft by profession; post a guild order request and the bot will ping available crafters in #crafters-corner

**With a guild account:**
- **Vote** — When a campaign is live (art vote, polls, etc.) you'll see it on the home page. Pick your ranked choices and submit.
- **Availability** (Settings → Availability) — Set which days of the week you're generally available to raid. Officers use this to plan events.

**To get an account:** DM the PATT bot directly and ask for an invite — it'll send you a registration code. Or ask an officer and they can generate one for you.

**🤖 The Bot**

- **Invite codes** — DM the bot and ask for a guild website invite; it'll send you a registration link automatically

- **Crafting orders** — When someone requests a guild craft on the website, the bot posts an embed in #crafters-corner tagging everyone who can make it
- **Campaign announcements** — Posts updates in the designated channel when voting milestones are hit
- **Registration** — Sends your invite code via DM when an officer generates one for you
